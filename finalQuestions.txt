False-

Which of the following is not necessary to apply agility to a software process?

How do you create agile processes to manage unpredictability?
Requirements gathering must be conducted very carefully
Risk analysis must be conducted before planning takes place

Software processes must adapt to changes incrementally
Both c and d-

In agile software processes the highest priorities is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
True-

True-
False

Which of the following can contribute to team toxicity?

Ch7:

Software engineering principles have about a three year half-life.
True
False-

Which of the following is not one of core principles of software engineering practice?
All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.
A software system exists only to provide value to its users.
Pareto principle (20% of any product requires 80% of the effort).-
Remember that you produce others will consume

Every communication activity should have a facilitator to make sure that the customer is not allowed to dominate the proceedings.
True
False-

The agile view of iterative customer communication and collaboration is applicable to all software engineering practice.
