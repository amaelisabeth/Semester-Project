Ch4:

The waterfall model of software development is
A reasonable approach when requirements are well defined.
A good approach when a working program is required quickly.
The best approach to use for projects with large development teams.
An old fashioned model that is rarely used any more.

The incremental model of software development is
A reasonable approach when requirements are well defined.
A good approach when a working core product is required quickly.
The best approach to use for projects with large development teams.
A revolutionary model that is not used for commercial products.

Evolutionary software process models
Are iterative in nature.
Can easily accommodate product requirements changes.
Do not generally produce throwaway systems.
All of the above.

The prototyping model of software development is
A reasonable approach when requirements are well defined.
A useful approach when a customer cannot define requirements clearly.
The best approach to use for projects with large development teams.
A risky model that rarely produces a meaningful product.

The spiral model of software development
Ends with the delivery of the software product.
Is more chaotic than the incremental model.
Includes project risks evaluation during each iteration.
All of the above.

The concurrent development model is
Another name for concurrent engineering.
Defines events that trigger engineering activity state transitions.
Only used for development of parallel or distributed systems.
Used whenever a large number of change requests are anticipated.
Both a and b

The component-based development model is
Only appropriate for computer hardware design.
Not able to support the development of reusable components.
Dependent on object technologies for support.
Not cost effective by known quantifiable software metrics.

The formal methods model of software development makes use of mathematical methods to
Define the specification for computer-based systems.
Develop defect free computer-based systems.
Verify the correctness of computer-based systems.
All of the above.

Which of these is not one of the phase names defined by the Unified Process model for software development?
Inception phase
Elaboration phase
Construction phase
Validation phase

Which of these is not a characteristic of Personal Software Process?
Emphasizes personal measurement of work product.
Practitioner requires careful supervision by the project manager.
Individual practitioner is responsible for estimating and scheduling.
Practitioner is empowered to control quality of software work products.

Which of these are objectives of Team Software Process?
Accelerate software process improvement
Allow better time management by highly trained professionals
Build self-directed software teams
Show managers how to reduce costs and sustain quality
Both b and c

Process technology tools allow software organizations to compress schedules by skipping unimportant activities.
True
False

It is generally accepted that one cannot have weak software processes and create high quality end products.
True
False

Ch5:

Agility is nothing more than the ability of a project team to respond rapidly to change.
True
False

Which of the following is not necessary to apply agility to a software process?
Eliminate the use of project planning and testing
Only essential work products are produced
Process allows team to streamline tasks
Uses incremental product delivery strategy

How do you create agile processes to manage unpredictability?
Requirements gathering must be conducted very carefully
Risk analysis must be conducted before planning takes place
Software increments must be delivered in short time periods
Software processes must adapt to changes incrementally
Both c and d

In agile software processes the highest priorities is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
True
False

In agile development it is more important to build software that meets the customers’ needs today than worry about features that might be needed in the future.
